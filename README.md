# Go improves Python?

This project is based on [this project](https://github.com/rochacbruno/rust-python-example) created by @rochacbruno. But this project uses [Golang](https://golang.org/) rather than [Rustlang](https://www.rust-lang.org).

THIS IS NOT A COMPETITION BETWEEN LANGUAGES! PLEASE THIS IS NOT A FLAME WAR! <3

This project has only one objective, which use Golang with Python as a possibility to have more performance on certain tasks.
